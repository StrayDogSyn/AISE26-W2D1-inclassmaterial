- ✅ Unzips aircraft.zip file
- ✅ Traverses directory with os.listdir()
- ✅ Loads JSON files with json module
- ✅ Creates aircraft.csv with csv.writer
- ✅ Writes header row and data rows
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully

### Execution Results

```
============================================================
Aircraft Data Converter: JSON to CSV
============================================================
✓ Successfully extracted aircraft.zip to aircraft_data/

Processing 6 JSON files...
  ✓ Processed: Airbus_A350-900.json
  ✗ Skipped: Airbus_A380-800.json (invalid JSON - caught error!)
  ✓ Processed: Boeing_747-100.json
  ✓ Processed: Cessna_172_Skyhawk.json
  ✓ Processed: Concorde.json
  ✓ Processed: Embraer_E175.json

✓ Successfully created aircraft.csv with 5 entries
```

### Generated CSV Output

```csv
manufacturer,model,introduced,length_ft,top_speed_mph,number_of_engines
Airbus,A350-900,2015,219.2,652.0,2
Boeing,747-100,1970,231.8,583,4
Cessna,172 Skyhawk,1956,27.2,188,1
Aérospatiale/BAC,Concorde,1976,202.4,1354,4
Embraer,E175,2005,103.8,545,2
```

### Best Practices Implemented

1. **Type Hints**: All functions have complete type annotations
   ```python
   def load_json_file(file_path: str) -> Optional[Dict]:
   ```

2. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Try-except blocks for all file operations
   ```python
   except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
       print(f"✗ Warning: Invalid JSON in {file_path}: {e}")
   ```

3. **Docstrings**: Every function has detailed documentation
   ```python
   """
   Unzip the aircraft.zip archive to a specified directory.
   
   Args:
       zip_path: Path to the zip file
       extract_to: Directory to extract files to
       
   Returns:
       Path to the extracted directory
   ```

4. **File Modes**: Proper use of 'r' (read) and 'w' (write) modes
5. **User Feedback**: Clear progress messages with ✓ and ✗ symbols
6. **Modular Design**: Each function has single responsibility
7. **Path Handling**: Uses os.path for cross-platform compatibility

### Reflection Answers

**Q: Did you encounter any issues with the files?**
A: Yes! The script detected and gracefully handled an invalid JSON file (`Airbus_A380-800.json`) with a malformed structure. The error was caught and logged, allowing the script to continue processing other files.

**Q: What is the difference between file open modes?**
A: 
- `r` (read): Opens file for reading only, fails if file doesn't exist
- `w` (write): Creates new file or overwrites existing, used for creating aircraft.csv
- `a` (append): Adds content to end of existing file without overwriting
- `x` (exclusive): Creates new file, fails if file already exists

## 🌤️ Breakout 2: OpenWeather API CLI App

### Requirements Met ✓

**Basic Requirements:**
- ✅ Loads API key from local text file
- ✅ Uses input() to prompt for city name
- ✅ Handles 'q' to quit
- ✅ Retrieves weather via OpenWeather API
- ✅ Displays temperature and weather condition
- ✅ Handles errors and prompts user again
- ✅ Prevents crashes with robust error handling

**Bonus Features (All Implemented):**
- ✅ `location` command - Sets location and displays weather
- ✅ `get` command - Retrieves cached data (10 different details)
- ✅ `log` command - Saves session to log.txt
- ✅ `help` command - Displays comprehensive help menu
- ✅ `quit` command - Exits gracefully
- ✅ Two modes: Simple and Extended

### Architecture

**Class-Based Design:**
```python
class WeatherApp:
    """
    A command-line weather application that interfaces with the OpenWeather API.
    
    Attributes:
        api_key: OpenWeather API key
        base_url: Base URL for OpenWeather API
        current_location: Currently set location
        weather_data: Cached weather data for current location
        log_messages: List of messages to be logged
    """
```

### Features Breakdown

#### 1. API Key Management
- Loads from separate `api_key.txt` file
- Never hardcoded in source
- Provides clear instructions if missing

#### 2. Error Handling Scenarios
```python
# HTTP Status Codes
- 200: Success
- 401: Invalid API key
- 404: City not found
- Timeout errors
- Connection errors
- Missing data fields
```

#### 3. Weather Details Available
1. **time** - Current date and time
2. **temperature** - Current temperature in °F
3. **feelslike** - "Feels like" temperature
4. **pressure** - Atmospheric pressure (hPa)
5. **sealevel** - Sea level pressure
6. **windspeed** - Wind speed (mph)
7. **winddirection** - Cardinal direction + degrees
8. **windgust** - Wind gust speed
9. **humidity** - Humidity percentage
10. **visibility** - Visibility in miles

#### 4. User Experience Features
- Beautiful formatted output with boxes
- Color-coded status messages (✓ and ✗)
- Comprehensive help menu
- Forgiving input parsing
- Session logging capability

### Best Practices Implemented

1. **Object-Oriented Design**: WeatherApp class encapsulates all functionality

2. **API Efficiency**: Caches data to minimize API calls
   ```python
   # 'location' queries API (max once per location)
   # 'get' uses cached data (no API call)
   ```

3. **Type Hints**: All methods fully annotated
   ```python
   def fetch_weather(self, city: str) -> Optional[Dict]:
   ```

4. **Comprehensive Docstrings**: Every method documented
   ```python
   """
   Fetch weather data from OpenWeather API for a given city.
   
   Args:
       city: Name of the city to query
       
   Returns:
       Dictionary containing weather data, or None if request fails
   """
   ```

5. **Error Recovery**: Never crashes, always provides feedback

6. **Security**: API key stored separately, not in code

7. **User Guidance**: Help menu and clear error messages

8. **Logging**: All actions recorded for debugging

### Reflection Answers

**Q: What errors did you predict users would cause?**
A: Multiple error scenarios were anticipated and handled:
- Typos in city names → Clear "not found" message
- Empty input → Prompt for valid input
- Network issues → Timeout and connection error handling
- Invalid API key → Specific error message with instructions
- Missing API key file → Setup instructions displayed
- Rate limiting → Caching strategy to minimize API calls

**Q: How did you manage your API key?**
A: Security considerations implemented:
- Stored in separate `api_key.txt` file (not in code)
- File should be added to `.gitignore`
- Template file provided for easy setup
- Never log or display the key
- Clear instructions for obtaining key
- Production recommendation: use environment variables
